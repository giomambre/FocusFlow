# FocusFlow - Smart Productivity Scheduler 

**FocusFlow** 

*"In today's fast-paced world, I have come to realize that our ability to focus and resist distractions is one of our most valuable assets. From my own experience, I often find time slipping away, leaving me with a lingering sense of unaccomplished goals and wasted hours. I have realized that frequent, often unnoticed distractions are what pull my attention away from what truly matters.
To address this challenge, I developed a desktop application designed to improve productivity by integrating deep work principles with intuitive task management.
Whether you're tackling a complex project or striving to minimize distractions, FocusFlow empowers you to stay on track, optimize your focus, and achieve your goals effectively."*

## ‚öôÔ∏è What I'm working on right now 
- Recurring activities
- Improved blocked sites page 
- A Gui (because the current one is not even a Gui) at the moment I'm working mainly on the backend of the app, so the frontend is very bad, and I know it
- **Future Ideas**: Weekly Summary of deep work hours, Syncing with iPhone to enable Do Not Disturb while being in a Session

## üöÄ Features
- **Daily and Weekly Schedules**: Create and visualize your tasks with time-specific activity blocks.
- **Distraction Blocking**: Automatically block unauthorized apps, files, and websites during focus sessions for uninterrupted work.
- **User-Friendly Design**: A sleek and intuitive interface built with Tkinter, featuring a visually appealing planner and seamless navigation.
- **Persistent Data**: Save your schedules and preferences in JSON format for continuity across sessions.
- Lightweight and built entirely with Python, making it easy to run and customize.
